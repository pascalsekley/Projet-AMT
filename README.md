In this repos we have a web application that runs on a wildfly server. The application is autodeployed on the the server.  
The application is launch via a docker container.

##Requirement  
1 - Install docker and docker-compose if it is not yet the case. Click [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox) to install.  
2 - Clone this repo to a folder of your choice.
````
git clone git@github.com:pascalsekley/Projet-AMT.git (if you have an ssh configuration on github)  
git clone https://github.com/pascalsekley/Projet-AMT.git (for https cloning)

##How to Run   
Assuming that you have cloned this repo and that you have installed docker on your machine.
Once you're in the root you have to build the app. Let's compile the war first:

1 - `mvn compile war:war`. 

Let's copy now the war file generated by the previous command into the same folder as the dockerfile.

2 - `cp target/Bootcamp1-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war images/wildfly/`

Navigate to the folder named topology-amt of the cloned directory and fire up docker-compose to start the server :
  
`docker-compose up --build`  
Notice that once the server is started the application is automatically deployed.
